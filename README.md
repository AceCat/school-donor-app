# School Donor App
## Project 2
## User Story:
1. User lands on users/login page and either logs in or makes a profile
2. User designates whether they are a school or a donor in registration
3. User is redirected to their profile page where they can post items
4. After an item is posted, user can mark the item closed if it is claimed
5. If user is a school, they can post items they desire or visit the 'browse' page to seek out items they desire
6. When schools click on items in the browser page, they are redirected to the item owner's profile page and can claim the items from there
7. If a user desires, on their profile page, they can click 'find schools near me' and schools in the database will appear
